        service possible. We have a flexible cancellation and refund policy as
        outlined below:

        <li>
          Cancellations are allowed only if requested within <strong>7 days</strong> of placing the order.
          Cancellation requests may not be accepted if the order has already been processed or shipped by our vendors or merchants.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not accept cancellations for perishable items such as flowers, food, or similar products.
          However, if the customer provides proof of poor product quality, a refund or replacement may be issued.
